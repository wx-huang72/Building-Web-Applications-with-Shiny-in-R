Course Description

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build highly interactive web apps directly in R. Using Shiny, data scientists can create interactive web apps that allow your team to dive in and explore your data as dashboards or visualizations. If you want to bring your data to life, Shiny is the way to go! Using data about baby names, food ingredients, and UFO sightings, you'll build a variety of different Shiny apps that leverage different inputs and outputs. You’ll also learn the basics of reactive expressions. By the end of this course, you’ll have the Shiny skills you need to build your first app in R.

Chapter 1 - Get Started with Shiny

To kick off the course you'll learn what a web app is and when you should build one, plus build a few apps of your own! You'll first learn to make text inputs and outputs in a few ways, including exploring the popularity of certain names over time.

Chapter 2 - Inputs, Outputs, and Layouts

In this chapter you will learn how to take advantage of different input and output options in shiny. You''ll learn the syntax for taking inputs from users and rendering different kinds of outputs, including text, plots, and tables.

Chapter 3 - Reactive Programming

In this chapter, you will learn about reactive programming. You will learn about reactive sources, conductors and endpoints and how they come together to drive the magic behind Shiny. You will also learn how to utilize your understanding of reactivity to build performant Shiny apps.

Chapter 4 - Build Shiny Apps

It’s time to build your own Shiny apps. You’ll make several apps from scratch, including one that allows you to gather insights from the Mental Health in Tech Survey and another that uses recipe ingredients as its input to accurately categorize different cuisines of the world. Along the way, you’ll also learn about more advanced input and output widgets, such as input validation, word clouds, and interactive maps.
